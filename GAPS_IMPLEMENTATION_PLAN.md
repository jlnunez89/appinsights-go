# Application Insights Go SDK - Gaps Implementation Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to address the known gaps in the Application Insights Go SDK as listed in the README. The plan is organized by complexity, priority, and implementation dependencies.

## Executive Summary

The Application Insights Go SDK currently has four main gaps that prevent it from meeting Microsoft's supported SDK standards:

1. **Operation Correlation** - Missing distributed tracing capabilities
2. **Sampling** - No telemetry volume reduction mechanisms
3. **Automatic Event Collection** - Requires manual instrumentation for all telemetry
4. **Offline Storage** - No persistence during network outages

This plan breaks down each gap into implementable tasks, estimates complexity, and defines implementation priorities.

## Gap 1: Operation Correlation

### Overview
Operation correlation enables linking related telemetry items across service boundaries using correlation IDs, essential for distributed tracing and request flow understanding.

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Framework Compatibility**: Auto-collection may not work with all Go frameworks
