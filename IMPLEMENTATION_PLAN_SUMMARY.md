# Implementation Plan for Known Gaps

I've created a comprehensive implementation plan to address all the known gaps mentioned in the README. The plan can be found in [GAPS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./GAPS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Summary

The plan addresses all four major gaps with a structured, phased approach:

### ðŸ”— Gap 1: Operation Correlation (Months 1-2)
- **Priority**: High | **Complexity**: Medium
- Core correlation infrastructure with W3C Trace Context support
- HTTP header propagation for distributed tracing
- Integration with all telemetry types

### ðŸ“Š Gap 2: Sampling (Months 2-5) 
- **Priority**: Highâ†’Medium | **Complexity**: Mediumâ†’High
- Fixed-rate sampling first, then adaptive and intelligent sampling
- Per-telemetry-type rates and dependency-aware sampling
- Statistical accuracy with performance optimization

### ðŸ¤– Gap 3: Automatic Event Collection (Months 3-9)
- **Priority**: Highâ†’Low | **Complexity**: Highâ†’Medium  
- HTTP middleware for requests and dependencies
- System metrics (CPU, memory, Go runtime stats)
- Database and message queue auto-instrumentation

### ðŸ’¾ Gap 4: Offline Storage (Months 4-12)
- **Priority**: Mediumâ†’Low | **Complexity**: Highâ†’Medium
- File-based persistence with store-and-forward pattern
- Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Alternative storage backends for different scenarios

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Months 1-3): Core infrastructure and high-priority features
- **Phase 2** (Months 4-6): Advanced features and storage capabilities  
- **Phase 3** (Months 7-12): Framework integration and additional backends

## Key Design Principles
- âœ… **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing APIs
- âš¡ **Performance**: <5% overhead for typical applications
- ðŸ”§ **Modularity**: Optional features that can be enabled/disabled
- ðŸ“– **Go Idiomatic**: Leverages context.Context and standard patterns
- ðŸ§ª **Testability**: >90% test coverage with comprehensive integration tests

## Risk Mitigation
- Extensive performance testing and benchmarking
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Framework compatibility testing

This plan will evolve the SDK from its current basic state to a comprehensive, production-ready solution that meets Microsoft's supported SDK standards while maintaining the simplicity Go developers expect.
